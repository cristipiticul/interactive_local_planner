ObstacleClassifier:
  robot_base_radius: 0.2 # must be the same with the one in costmap_common_params.yaml

  # Let "dist" be the distance from the first collision pose to a detected obstacle.
  # If dist < robot_base_radius + max_additional_distance, then we consider that
  # the collision pose corresponds to the detected obstacle.
